Hello to all of you. Today I solved another quiztime challenge which is nice and tricky to pinpoint the location. Challenge was posted by Julia Bayer, here you go. [Challenge - 15 May 2017](https://twitter.com/bayer_julia/status/864023752664862720) . Question is **"Where exactly did I make this pic?"**.
