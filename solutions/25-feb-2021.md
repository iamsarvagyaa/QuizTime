Hey, quiztime family :heart: This is my first solution-post and I'm a newbie in verification. Pardon me, if there's any mistake. On 25 February 2021 Twone2 posted a challenge - [look at this](https://twitter.com/twone2/status/1364668148868341765), which was a pretty easy and interesting challenge. Here you go :)

I started exploring image and I got lot of clues: 

- A lighthouse, 
- group of island
- a Turkish flag,

First of all, I started searching **island with lighthouse in turkey** and Google shows a lot of results but one or two images are similar from question-image.

Now, it's time to see the map and start matching all clues in respected Geo-areas. Searched **Gelidonya Lighthouse**, and I got this result in Google earth:
